				<h3>Research</h3>
				<h4>Bottles Be Gone, <i>Synthetic Biology Research Project</i></h4>
				<p2><b>Summary:</b> (Poly)ethylene terephthalate (PET), a plastic used in disposable water bottles, is not biodegradable and accumulates in our worldâ€™s oceans, causing pollution and environmental damage. Our project proposes an engineered strain of Bacillus tianshenii, a gram-positive, spore-forming, halotolerant bacteria for bioremediation of these plastics. This strain would contain the gene for plastic-degrading enzyme PETase, originating from gram-negative bacteria Ideonella sakaiensis. The bacteria, in their inactive spore form, would be placed alongside dried nutrients underneath a full-length water bottle label. When the bacteria are exposed to the high salinity conditions of the ocean, the bacteria would germinate and produce PETase, degrading the bottle and the label.</p2>

			    			<p3>I've been a figure skater for 14 years. I am a New England Regional Competitor as well as an instructor of the U.S. Figure Skating Association's Basic Skills Program. When in NYC, I enjoy skating the 7am sessions at Bryant Park, for which the view is always worth the early morning.</p3>

			    			<h5>Science Education</h5>
			    			<p3>My personal exprience with biotechnology education happened through the BioBuilder program, which is a synthetic biology education nonprofit. Joining the biotech community has given me a perspective on how inadequate access to science education is, particularly for emerging and hands-on fields. In my career, I hope to take steps towards reducing this educational disparity.</p3>
