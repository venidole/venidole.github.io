				<h1>Veni Dole</h1>
				<h2> Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology @Columbia</h2>
				<p> Hello! I'm Veni, a first-year at Columbia University's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences studying Chemical Engineering with a concentration in Biotechnology. <br> My passions include molecular engineering research, synthetic biology, diversity in scientific spaces, and biotechnology education. I'm looking to gain experience in laboratory research and hope to work in startup environements.</p>

				<h3>@ Columbia</h3>
				<div class="SWE">
					<h4>Society of Women Engineers, <i>Organizational Committee Member of Alumni Committe</i></h4>
					<p2>As a board member of the Society of Women Engineers, I plan events for our committee members and general body <br>members. Since I am on the Alumni Committee, I cultivate connections with our club alumni and organize events for them <br>to connect with current members.</p2>

				<div class="HSO">
					<h4>Hindu Students Organization, <i>Board Member</i></h4>
					<p2>The Hindu Students Organization hosts cultural events for the Columbia community. These events are often centered around <br>religious festivals. As a board member, I help coordinate events including planning food, decorations, venue, and advertising.</p2>

				<h3>Research</h3>
				<h4>Bottles Be Gone, <i>Synthetic Biology Research Project</i></h4>
				<p2><b>Summary:</b> (Poly)ethylene terephthalate (PET), a plastic used in disposable water bottles, is not biodegradable and accumulates in our world’s oceans, causing pollution and environmental damage. Our project proposes an engineered strain of Bacillus tianshenii, a gram-positive, spore-forming, halotolerant bacteria for bioremediation of these plastics. This strain would contain the gene for plastic-degrading enzyme PETase, originating from gram-negative bacteria Ideonella sakaiensis. The bacteria, in their inactive spore form, would be placed alongside dried nutrients underneath a full-length water bottle label. When the bacteria are exposed to the high salinity conditions of the ocean, the bacteria would germinate and produce PETase, degrading the bottle and the label.</p2>

			    			<h5>Science Education</h5>
			    			<p3>My personal exprience with biotechnology education happened through the BioBuilder program, which is a synthetic biology education nonprofit. Joining the biotech community has given me a perspective on how inadequate access to science education is, particularly for emerging and hands-on fields. In my career, I hope to take steps towards reducing this educational disparity.</p3>
